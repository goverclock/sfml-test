order by priority

[] connection management
	[x] when guest joins a room entry, it trys to establish a TCP connection to the host
	[] once connected
		[x] guest start sending periodical heartbeat(through the TCP connection) to host to indicate its signal strength
		[] host updates guest signal strength with their heartbeat packets
		[] host send guest list to the newly connected guest so they can initialize their room UI
		[] host still sends periodical UDP broadcast to indicate its signal strength to all guests
			[] if TCP connection is lost but UDP broadcast is still received, try re-connect
	[] in the room
		[] when host finds a new guest has joined the room, it tells all guests(through the TCP connection) about it so they can update their room UI
		[] when a guest exits the room, it tells the host(TCP), then disconnect
		[] when host finds a guest has exited, it tells all guests(TCP) about it so they can update their room UI
		[] host clicks start game...

[] coalesce all periodical work into one single thread

[x] lobby screen to show all discovered rooms

[x] click a room to join it

[] room screen shows all connected guests

[x] remove linux proprietary headers, to compile it on windows

[] tell room name to guests with the broadcast message

[x] refactor lan with SFML network lib

[x] button class

[] host send a message to indicate the room has dismissed

[x] list view class, maybe a widget lib

[] use namespace for each lib

[] lazy rendering if performance needed

[] replace all render() into draw(), aka sf::Drawable
